## Problem Statement: List Operations using streams

This exercise should be completed using Test Driven Development Technique

  - Test classes provided in this exercise will show compilation errors, when the exercise is cloned locally
  - Classes and methods should be created by analysing the test code, so that there are no compilation errors
  - Functionality of methods should be completed, such that all the test cases pass 
  - Some of the requirements/hints are mentioned below
  
  ```
   In this problem, country names have to searched and sorted from the given input collections containing country names and capital names of countries 
        
   - Following functionality needs to be implemented
   
        - search a given country from the given list of countries
        - sort the given list of countries in ascending oeder
        - extract distinct countries from the given list of countries and sort them in ascending order of the number of characters in country name
        - search the country for a given capital from the given collection of country names and capital names
   
   - Empty and null inputs should be checked       
   ```

**NOTE: ALL THE METHODS SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED USING STREAMS API ONLY** 
         
## Instructions
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Do not change the provided class/method names unless instructed
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
